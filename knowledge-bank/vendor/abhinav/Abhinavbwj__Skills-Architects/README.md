## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use as a Plugin

```bash
claude --plugin-dir "/path/to/Architect Skills"
```

### Option 2: Copy to Your Project

```bash
cp -r skills/ your-project/.claude/skills/
```

Once installed, just ask Claude anything about building architecture. The system activates automatically — no slash commands required for most tasks.

---

## How It Works

Architect Skills uses a **progressive disclosure architecture** to stay lean while encoding deep knowledge:

```
User asks anything about building architecture
        |
        v
architect-foundations (auto-fires, invisible to user)
  - Applies baseline knowledge from 50+ theorists and frameworks
  - Routes to specialized skills as needed
        |
        v
Specialized skill loads (e.g., building-envelope, spatial-planning)
  - Follows structured workflow
  - Loads deep reference files on demand
        |
        v
architect-calculator provides precise computations when needed
  - 7 Python scripts for area, U-value, daylight, egress,
    structural loads, energy demand, and cost estimation
```

### Three-Layer Context Management

| Layer | What Loads | When | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Layer 0** | Skill names + descriptions only | Always in context | ~18KB |
| **Layer 1** | Full SKILL.md body | On skill invocation | ~450-815 lines each |
| **Layer 2** | Reference files, templates, scripts | Only when explicitly needed | Varies |

This keeps the context window efficient. Claude never loads knowledge it doesn't need for the current task.

## Tri-Scalar Ecosystem

Architect Skills is the **building-scale pillar** in a tri-scalar AEC knowledge system:

| Scale | Plugin | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **City** | Urban Design Skills (v1.2.0) | Masterplanning, street design, public space, TOD, zoning, sustainability scoring |
| **Building** | **Architect Skills (v1.0.0)** | **Programming, typology, spatial planning, envelope, structure, services, codes, sustainability** |
| **Component** | Computational Design Skills (v1.0.0) | Parametric modeling, generative design, computational geometry, fabrication, BIM scripting |

Together, these three plugins encode the full spectrum of AEC design intelligence — from "How wide should the boulevard be?" to "What wall build-up achieves U=0.15?" to "How do I panelize this facade into planar quads?"
